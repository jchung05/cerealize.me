Biscuits and Gravy! This was a special morning meal.
One of my favorites among the canon breakfast choices.
I asked for it specifically after doing a favor for the cantina.
I would have to say it was worth way more than the time I spent!
The gravy was made with sausage and bacon, you could taste
savory magic in every bite. I reloaded on gravy a few times to
finish the fresh baked biscuits and left ready for the day!
So what is it I'm thinking about...

Today I'm thinking about **More C++**:

Busy for now, working on the C++ project, I'll be back later to talk about what I learn!

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine and C++ Piscine
* Machine learning project
* Contract work! (Or be hungry on vacation!)

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

until later, when I finish this post!
