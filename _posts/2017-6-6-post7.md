## Buttermilk Pancakes with Cinnamon Apples and Bacon

This post is a delayed post, I forgot to do it the day of this amazing meal.
The sixth of June was a great day. Started off with a fantastic breakfast.
The bacon was savory and the pancakes sweet and delicious.

Yesterday (6th of June), I was thinking about J-Gravity.
The project is crazy cool. We are making an nbody simulation to test the Janus Model.
The Janus Model strives to explain the momentum of the universe.
Questions like: why we haven't slowed down yet? How do we get spiral galaxies?
It was also my Mother's birthday. Happy birthday Mom!

The TODO list:
* Program more!
* J-Gravity website and backend
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in hercules projects
* Revisit the taut.tech project

Still have a lot to do. I have to write the post from today.
I won't have time to fix my workflow for the blog.
But eventually!
