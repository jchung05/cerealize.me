Cheddar cheese and vanilla yogurt with blueberries and mango.
Another simple but super breakfast in the sun.
I'm still waking up too early,
with the sunshine hitting my window at 3am it's tough!
Today I have time for my thoughts, and maybe catch up a few days I skipped!

Today I'm thinking about **Emmaboda**:
So why am I in Sweden?
Many reasons really, but the first thing that come to mind is Emmaboda.
Emmaboda is town in the south of the country. It's home to a festival:
Emmabodafestivalen. Six days of camping and music with the youth of Sweden.
This year marks (or so they say) the final Emmabodafestivalen. I couldn't
miss it, as it's the event that ties back to the friends and fun I've had
each year I've visited Europe. It's a long story how it all started.
I'll it save for some other time and just end with a link to the
[psychedelic website](http://www.emmabodafestivalen.se/) for the festival.

The TODO list:
* Gather supplies for the festival

The Ice Box:
* Write more for old posts
* Buy ticket to Paris

Do you have a trip you like to take?

What about a trip you want to take?

Wishing you a super summer,
