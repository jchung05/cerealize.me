This morning there is meat frittata for breakfast at the 42 cantina.
Although it must have been popular, since I'm here waiting for the second round to get my plate.
I found a picture of frittata online on Wikimedia for you to view.
Today I'm thinking about the C Exam that I will be proctoring, and about the interview with [Nicolas Sadirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sadirac)
who is in the United State to talk to the students at 42 US about our first year here.

It's interesting to think that the school has been open for a year.
I've been here since the 21st of September, that is after spending a month here in August for my piscine.
It's been an amazing time so far and I've learned more than I even imagined.
I've certainly been staying busy. I have to get into the school right now!

TODO:

* Finish Breakfast.
* Proctor the Exam.
* Talk to Nicolas.
* Contract Work.
* School Work.

Update: 2017-6-9 and 2017-6-10

The picture should be working now, it's a real picture of the meal I ate.
I wanted to get that going. It's much better to see the real deal
You can still find the wiki-media online.
I updated my format for later posts, but thanks for checking out the old ones!
Updated to have yml front matter on each post.
