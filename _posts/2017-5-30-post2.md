The start of Cerealize Me, a blog for breakfast.

So the plan for this blog is simple, what am I having for breakfast?
What am I thinking about?
Provide a picture.

This morning there is meat fritatta for breakfast at the 42 cantina.
Althought it must have been popular, since I'm here waiting for the second round to get my plate.
I found a picture of fritatta online on wikimedia for you to view.
Today I'm thinking about the C Exam that I will be proctoring, and about the interview with [Nicolas Sadirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sadirac)
who is in the United State to talk to the students at 42 US about our first year here.

It's intresting to think that the school has been open for a year.
I've been here since the 21st of Septemeber, that is after spending a month here in August for my piscine.
It's been an amazing time so far and I've learned more than I even imagined.
I've certainly been staying busy. I have to get into the school right now!

TODO:
