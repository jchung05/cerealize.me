![Eggs, Sausage & Churro Biscuit](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-7.jpg)
This morning after I had already eaten my eggs I remembered how much I enjoy having them with salt and pepper.
Despite the picture being scrambled eggs, I had mine sunny side up. The yolk was great.
The churro biscuit is still waiting for me back at the room. It now sounds like a perfect snack.

Today I'm thinking about 'The Bocal':

The staff and volunteers that run 42 School work in a part of the school called 'The Bocal'.
In Paris at the original campus it got it's name from it's location in the center of a glass box.
The word 'Bocal' means something like 'fish-bowl'. Here at 42 US we are in the back corner of the top floor.
I wish we were in the center of the School. It would be better. But as it is for now is still great.
It wasn't very long ago I would avoid entering the Bocal as much as possible.
The attitude has changed and students come to ask questions
(although nothing like asking a teacher or professor a question)
and the system is evolving and getting better each day.
It's super exciting to be a part of 42, and even cooler to be in the Bocal!

The TODO list:
* FIX IMAGES FOR THESE POSTS!
* J Gravity website, more backend / new pages
* Program more!
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in hercules projects
* Revisit the taut.tech project

The TODO list isn't changing much. So I need to get on that.
Today I wrote both this and the last post since I forgot in the rush of things.
I hope to get back in the swing of things and make sure I write this at breakfast.
I keep writing them when I can, but I should be able to write them at breakfast.
That's the point after all!
