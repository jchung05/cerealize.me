![French Toast with Cherries & Cream](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-13.jpg)
A sweet breakfast of swirled french toast topped with a cream cheese sauce and cherries.
Enjoyed along side a glass of apple juice and two plump sausage links.
I even ate the crust today! I woke up early enough to take my time with the meal.
It's important to enjoy such a tasty treat slowly.

Today I'm thinking about the pencil game '24':

I'm on a kick for easy-to-play games.
Pencil and paper games like you can find on [papg.com](http://www.papg.com/).
Today I was playing, and convincing others to play '24'.
It's easy to learn too! Take four numbers, or have two players take two numbers.
Combine them with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Here is an example: 2 4 6 8 will play the part of the numbers.
To get to 24 we have a few choices for this set.
Here comes the answer: 2 * 3 * 6 / 4 = 24

Can you solve this one?
Here are the numbers 3 8 3 8
The solution can be found online, or in today's picture!

The TODO list:
* J-Gravity link with Dispatcher
* Start new contract work
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* Turn in a Hercules project
* ~~J-Gravity Production~~

J-Gravity is in production, it just needs linked to the outside world.
Soon you will find it on [jgravity.42.us.org](https://jgravity.42.us.org)!
How much of this list can I strike out before tomorrow?
I bet I can get rid of most of it with a few word changes...
Ah yes, that looks better. How can you make your day easier?
How can you challenge yourself?

Challenging you to a fun and productive day,
