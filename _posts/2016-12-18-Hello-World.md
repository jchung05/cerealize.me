# Hello World!

I've been looking for a super easy way to get a blog up and running.
I guess this has been a thing for awhile and I would have to say it's awesome.

So to start things off right:
##Hello World!

Have you ever done this:
 ![echo "Hello World!" ](http://i.imgur.com/qKmGsoW.png "Too excited")
 
 I know that !! runs the last command, but I don't know why this acts this way.
 I'll find out and report back here- or feel free to leave a comment when I get comments working!

Got this up and running really easy with [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
