Today I woke up later than normal so I had to take what I could get for breakfast.
Luckily here that still means good eats.
Three buttermilk pancakes with a nice slice of ham and a plum.
It was perfect. So much so that I started eating before I took a picture.
The photographed meal above is simply at a flattering angle that doesn't show how hungry I was this morning!
The plum and my glass of lemon-strawberry infused water were a delicious ending to the beginning of my day!

Today I'm thinking about `The Command Line`:

This week and next we have a two-week Ruby Piscine for high schoolers.
It's exciting to see children near adulthood sharing a passion for coding.
Today is just an intro to the command line and the systems we use here at 42.
But the information they will learn over the next 12 days will be a strong foundation.
With that foundation and the unique perspectives they will each bring to the field
the future is exciting! How about some basics for breakfast?

You might already know these, but if not I hope it helps!

`man` - Read the manual for a command. Example: `man man` or `man mkdir`
You might find that the manual pages are hard to read at first.
They are pretty tough, but they have really good information!

`mkdir` - Create a directory. Example: `mkdir my_folder` would make a directory called my_folder.
Another example, if you wanted a place to store today's photos might be `mkdir photos_2017_6_19`.
I like to avoid spaces in my filenames since they are harder to use in the command line.

`cd` - This command, 'change directory', helps you navigate around your folders and files.
Example: `cd my_folder` would take you into the directory (if you made it earlier) called `my_folder`.
This command works really well alongside the next two.

`ls` - list, this command will be your friend. It lists all the files and directories in your
`working directory` which is the folder you are currently in. From the home folder, when using `ls`
you might see things like `Desktop` `Photos` `Documents` and more. Try using `ls` on the desktop.
Hint: `cd ~/Desktop && ls` this command will change directories to the `Desktop` and run `ls`!

`pwd` - Print working directory will show you the `PATH` to the directory you are currently in.
from the home folder for a user on a mac this looks something like: `/Users/my_username`.
From inside the lab it might look more like `/nfs/2017/f/fakeperson`. Even this is bound to change.
The new version of Mac OSX has a new file system. Always be ready to learn something new!

`history` - This helpful command will show you the last 500 or so commands you used.
You can change the amount in your settings. Review all the commands you use regularly to learn!

That's enough for today. If you have questions feel free reach out to me!

The TODO list:
* Contract work
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

Alright, it's about time I get on with my day and see how I can help everyone this morning.
It's going to be an exciting next two weeks.

Let's learn something new every chance,
