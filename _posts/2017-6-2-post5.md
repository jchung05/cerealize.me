## Egg, Ham and Cheese Croissant

I stayed up way too late, but that wasn't going to stop me from getting the fantastic breakfast offered this morning.
A wonderful flaky, warm, fresh croissant with a side of fruit.
The yolk made the whole thing melt along with the buttery-fall-apart magic that is croissant.

Today I'm thinking about  'Moulinette'.

I have a peer having an issue with the robotic and soulless unit test known only as Moulinette.
It isn't passing them, despite 15 other peers having no problem with the code.
I couldn't sleep, so when I walked over to the lab. I found three other of my peers.
They, without him even being there, were taking apart every line of his code.
Why doesn't it pass? We still don't know. But we will find out.
Human kindness will always prevail over the cold and heartless unit tests.
But I know that rigor is what we are here to learn.
I'm just happy to see we already have learned something that can't be taught.

Ah yes, the TODO list:
* Figure it out (unit test libft_part1 timeout ???)
* Accounting, walk to the bank.
* Program more!
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in hercules projects
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* ~~Wolf3d with SNES controller~~

Today I'm taking the time to revist taut.tech, another blog / community of this codebase.
It's all based of the JekellNow repo, which has taught me much about static site generation.
I can make this process better. But for now, I can go back and fix the images and be happy with
that step toward a better blog.

I Fixed the image.
I didn't really do many of the things I planned at the end of this post.
I still need to get around to doing all of that.
A better process is in the works.
