## French Toash Drizzled with Chocolate and a Sausage Patty 

Chocolate for breakfast? It wasn't what I was expecting this morning, but I guess I could have looked at the menu! It was tasty none-the-less and it was rather sweet. I added a bit of syrup to finish the job. A glass of orange juice, an apple and an apricot. I'll be snacking on that fruit as the morning goes on.

Today I'm thinking about 'The Lab':

I was thinking about a few things this morning, my friend was dining with me for breakfast so things like 'Fillit' and LEGO passed my mind. But as I finished writing the TODO list below and my see-ya blurb I found myself thinking about 'The Lab'. 'The Lab' is what we call the part of 42 Silicon Valley where all the computers are. I like this name, since it gives the ears and mind the idea that we are researching and preforming science! We are learning and it has roots back to the part of me that never left schooling at all, the computer labs and classrooms. So now when you hear me talking about 'The Lab' I'll just be calling it the lab. Because it's that much easier to say than 'the part of 42 silicon valley where all the computer are'. Some of my peers seem to get stuck at the dorms. Myself and many others from what I've found, have trouble staying away from the lab. It call us back to our work and the community of 42. Which invites us to the future of our dreams.

The TODO list:
* Send off the Doodle
* J-Gravity Production
* J-Gravity link with Dispatcher
* FIX IMAGES FOR THESE POSTS!
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in hercules projects
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* ~~J Gravity website, more backend / new pages~~
* ~~Program more!~~ program even more!

The TODO list is moving again. Hey! I'm even writing this at the breakfast table. I took a great picture of the food again today. So I need to FIX IMAGES FOR THESE POSTS! Like I have listed above. That way we can all enjoy some food for the eyes. I'm sure I have something bigger and closer to work on, but it escapes me at the moment. I'll think about it as I walk to 'The Lab'. Oh! It just hit me! I need to walk to the post office and send off the doodle I made for a friend on the internet!
