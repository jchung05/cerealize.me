![Two Eggs and Hash Browns](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-21.jpg)
Eggs over-easy with golden hash browns, a plum and a banana.
I washed it all down with a glass of orange juice.
Morning-time conversation was also great!
I'm learning more everyday and it's always fun to share my opinions.
What a better place than with friends at the breakfast table?

Today I'm thinking about **Python**:

`Python` is another programing language!
When learning about programming I think it's a great idea
to look into all of the options and communities you have to work with.
`Python` is a slightly older language than `Ruby`, but still very new compared to `C`!
It has been widely adopted by academia and has seen many uses.

`Python` is installed by default on almost all linux systems.
It's a great tool to learn if you want to quickly build applications.

It doesn't have some of the magic `Ruby` has, nor the human readability.
But what it lacks in magic and natural understanding, it provides in explicitly.
You know where your functions are coming from, and what they effect.

These difference are subtle until you are comfortable with a language,
if you are just starting with either language the best place to start is with a community. What are your friends using? Who can help you if you get stuck?

It would feel unfair to `Python` after my post on `Ruby`
to not provide a good place to start learning.
So here is an online book:
[thinkpython](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html)
and the `Python` homepage at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

No matter where you are in your quest to learn try your best to know what your next goal is. Build small projects while building your skill level everyday. Create a big project by building onto smaller projects or take the time to plan a path to completion for a major project.

__Fun is at the core of programming.__

Take for example: [why is it called Python](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python).

Do you have to have fun to program?

No, but it helps :)


The TODO list:
* Contract work (at least 2 hours)
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

I hope you have a good breakfast too, and that your conversations today are meaningful. What can we learn today?

Let's ask ourselves today:

Why is some learning fun, and other learning dull?

Until tomorrow, and today another fantastic day!
