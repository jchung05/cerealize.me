Today I'm thinking about **Python**:

But I have to write about it! Wait a few minutes!

The TODO list:
* Contract work (at least 2 hours)
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

Write a conclusion too!
Wait a few minutes, I just woke up and ate!

Onto another fantastic day!
