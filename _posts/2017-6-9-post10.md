## Bacon Spinach and Cheese Quiche

Quiche is always a treat. Served with cantaloupe and water melon.
It was a good mix of salty and sweet.
I enjoyed a glass of water and a banana with the meal too.
It's Friday and I'd have to say: I'm ready for the day!


Today I'm thinking about sleep:

I made it into the cantina relatively early for my normal time.
Across from where I sat a group of other students were talking.
I heard some claims from the group about not needing much sleep.
I was really interested in where the claims came from.
Studies with mice and memory. Object recognition and brain scans.
I spoke about what I had recently heard in opposition.
Now we will be exchanging sources to get to the bottom of it all!
I know one assumption I've made over the years:
I can't stay up all night without really feeling it the next day.
So I have to get as much sleep, quality sleep, as I can.
If I remember I'll post the links in here for you too!
Get quality sleep, and 7-9 hours of it.
That's my suggestion for now!
(sadly without the science to back at the moment)

The TODO list:
* FIX IMAGES FOR THESE POSTS!
* J-Gravity Production
* J-Gravity link with Dispatcher
* Turn in Hercules projects
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* ~~Send off the Doodle~~

I fixed the image for yesterday, but I need to fix it for all the posts.
I walked the letter / doodle to the mail yesterday and it was therapeutic.
I should send more mail. Oh! Laptop is about to die.
I also should leave the cantina, I've been here for an hour this morning!

Until Monday,
