Cinnamon French Toast Crunch

So that isn't the picture of the meal I had this morning, It's looks even better.
I'll come back and change the image but for now, wikimedia is covering for my lazyness.
It was french toast covered in crumbles of the cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
I couldn't eat the edges of the bread since I was stuffed from just the one slice of thick toast.
It came with strawberries and two slices of bacon, which I enjoyed very much.

Today I'm thinking about my contract work, I need to get enough of it done that it can be depositied into my bank account.
I currently get charged for having the account open, which is madness. I don't think it's fair that banks can do that.
Speaking of which, I need to make sure I have the money in the account so that if that happens, I don't get charged more.
I should walk over an deposit the money today. Among fixing my paypal account and my duties at 42 as a student and staff.

So here is the TODO list:
* Contract work 
* Accounting
* Yoga
* Programming

I should take time, if I can find it, to make posting to this blog much easier.
Right now I do it from the github built-in editor, which many would call 'bad'.
It works, so I don't look down on it, but I would rather be able to edit in vim.
The process would be complicated further if I couldn't name the file and automatically push.
So the framework I need to build names the post, let's me type what I need to, then pushes for me.
I also should takle the picture problem, these wikimedia photos are the full size.
That makes the load on my page really heavy, for what is just a few slices of french toast.
