Eggs and bacon make up the iconic morning duo.
A bowl of cereal and an apple juice spritzer also.
An excellent early eat! What can I learn today?

Today I'm thinking about **More C++**:

Busy for now, working on the C++ project, I'll be back later to talk about what I learn!

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine and C++ Piscine
* Machine learning project
* Contract work! (Or be hungry on vacation!)

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

until later, when I finish this post!
