![Cheese & Sausage Quesadilla with Potatoes & Cantina Salsa](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-15.jpg)
Another savory start to the day!
The zesty-mild cantina salsa complemented the fried potatoes and
went splendidly with the chorizo quesadilla.
The quesadilla was full of eggs and cheese.
I'm stuffed from this heavy but delicious meal.
I drank a glass of apple juice with the meal, and a glass of water after.  

Today I'm thinking about PHP:

I know some PHP, but not enough that I would call myself highly skilled.
These last two weeks, for some students, have been what we call a Piscine.
A Piscine is a coding challenge that lasts anywhere from two to four weeks.
Each day of the week the students are given tasks they must solve.
Often more than should fit in one day!
They are structured to teach the students involved a topic.
But the twist is there are no teachers. Just you, your peers and the challenges.
Each weekend there are partner projects called rushes and in certain Piscines
there are exams. Not for the PHP piscine (lucky for them).
I passed this particular piscine last time it ran earlier this year.
But I am always humbled by watching another group of my peers learn even more.
Makes me want to keep learning more PHP! Which to some sounds insane I'm sure.
Want to learn more about PHP? The best place to start is
[here](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php).
Not at 42?
Maybe you want to [learn a lot more](https://www.42.us.org/) than just PHP.

The TODO list:
* Finish the J-Gravity website
* ~Start new contract work~
* ~Teach scale creation to bocalian peers~

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

So, I haven't gotten around to the items on my todo list so long I'm freezing a few of them. Maybe seeing them out in the cold of 'The Ice Box' will help me find the fire in my heart to finish them. It will at least let me focus 100% on what is important: finishing the J-Gravity website.

Onto our focused and productive day full of fun and accomplishment,
