The breakfast this morning was scrambled eggs and a wonderful ham hash.
The potatoes and ham were super savory and the eggs, which I had with ketchup were fantastic.
Along with glass of orange juice I had a great conversation with friends and a banana!
It was a filling meal for a day when I need to be full! Now it's time to learn!
So what is it I'm thinking about...

Today I'm thinking about **More C++**:

Busy for now, working on the C++ project, I'll be back later to talk about what I learn!

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine and C++ Piscine
* Machine learning project
* Contract work! (Or be hungry on vacation!)

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

until later, when I finish this post!
