Pancakes are a great start to the day, I am pretty busy this morning so I'll have to write about how much I enjoyed them later!

Today I'm thinking about **Post It / Sticky Notes**:

Super busy, I'll be back tonight!

So I didn't make it back to this post for a few days.

This day, or the day after it (not really sure anymore), the ruby piscine
took to the walls and windows and made post it note art all over the lab!
It looks fantastic. Party parrots and Pikachu! I should link you to the picture:

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine
* Turn in J Gravity
* Finish this post! and YESTERDAYS!

The Ice Box:
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine
* Contract work (at least 2 hours)
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

I'll come back and finish this!

I mean it this time!

So that's all I have to say about this day.
It's certainly harder when you are busy to find meaningful things to express.
So that will be my message today:

Are you too busy to stop and smell the roses?

Would a little more action help you, or tip you over?

Hoping are happily expressing yourself in thought and action,
