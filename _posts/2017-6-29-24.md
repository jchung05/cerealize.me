Ah yes, protein and starch, and some sugar from my orange juice too!
It's great to see the menu come back to life after how busy (and how late)
I've been getting into the Cantina this week. So what am I thinking about?
Well other than how great breakfast was...  

Today I'm thinking about **The Cantina**:

I haven't written about the fantastic establishment
that I get this wonderful breakfast from! How rude of me!
Ã‰cole 42 USA, also known as 42 Silicon Valley has a restaurant at the
Nostromo Dorms. It opens at 7 AM for breakfast and closes at 9 AM.
It's the best $4 breakfast ever. I am friends with the amazing people
that make it happen and that makes it even better. The have lunch and dinner,
but I haven't started that blog yet! You can find more details as a 42 student at:
[cantina.42.us.org](https://cantina.42.us.org/) or in the #_cantina slack channel.
You need food to replenish yourself after coding all day.
I hope to see you there!

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine
* Email C++ Invite to all Cadets (Lv 7+)
* Organize and get ready for more chaos!

The Ice Box:
* Contract work (call my manager)
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

Do you have a favorite breakfast spot?

What is your favorite meal of the day?

Do you think that having the right nutrition in the morning makes for a better day?

To the best meals and the best friends,
