A savory meal, perfect for starting the day. My omelet, made to order, was
sausage and bacon with spinach. I enjoyed every bite. I sauced up the meal with a bit of ketchup. I personally enjoy the taste with my eggs and potatoes.
To drink, a wonderful glass of orange juice with just a spritz of soda.

Today I'm thinking about the **Summer of Love**:

Last night I went up to the city to enjoy the
`Surreal “Summer of Love” Solstice Jam & Light Show`.
It was amazing, music from the late 60s and crowds of happy people.
They encouraged attendees to wear tie-dye, have fun and invoke the
feelings of the Endless Summer of Love.

I have quite a few tunes in my ears I still need to track down.

At the end of the show the host told us about his website
(very San Francisco) and that the whole show would be uploaded.
I heard "Moon Atlas" but searching this morning, I can't find it.

Well. I'll find some of the music and link it to you here soon!
For now, remember what the dormouse said...<br>
[Jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vl89g2SwMh4).

Here is one I had never heard that spoke to me:<br>
[Strawberry Alarm Clock - Incense And Peppermints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYLz63csS0)

This is also fantastic:<br>
[Lemon Pipers - Green Tambourine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Vz-z4PEkk)

The TODO list:
* J-Gravity Dispatcher link
* Contract work (4+ hours behind)

The Ice Box:
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

A trip down memory lane can be shared timelessly.

Can you hear echoes of the past that still ring true today?

Let's ask ourselves today:

What can I learn from the people around me?

What can I learn from the music I hear?

Stay tuned-in and have an amazing day,

`- qst0`
