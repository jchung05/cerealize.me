This morning for breakfast: scrambled eggs with a light salt and pepper.
I enjoyed my savory treat served with tater tots and ketchup.
I finished the meal with a side of apple juice and an actual apple.
To top it all off, a bowl of cereal. Surprisingly a first time on the blog!

Today I'm thinking about the pencil game 'Sim':

Draw six points that would form a hexagon if you drew lines between them.
If you fill in all of the lines you will end with 15 lines.
Five lines will come off each point. If you take turns with another player,
or even yourself. You will always find at least one triangle in a single color.
The triangle is made from point to point.
Many other small triangles will appear from intersections that do not count.
In the avoidance variant of the game, players take turns making connections
trying to avoid being the player that forms the monochromatic triangle.
If you want to take a quick break today, let's play a game!
Read more about the research behind the game
[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/9911004.pdf).

The TODO list:
* J-Gravity Production
* J-Gravity link with Dispatcher
* Contract work
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* Turn in Hercules projects
* ~~FIX IMAGES FOR THESE POSTS!~~

A new week starts and it's time to crunch this list.
Starting with J-Gravity, then my contract work.
The lower items on the list need help too, but I have to prioritize.
I should take a look at the menu and see what breakfast is tomorrow!

Until then,
