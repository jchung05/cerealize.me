![Maple Bacon Waffle](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-20.jpg)
Back to the morning schedule, and just in time!
I walked into the Cantina this morning to a fresh maple bacon waffle.
There was homemade apple cinnamon butter and fresh apple juice to boot!
I ate the tasty breakfast outside after a few moments in the warming sun.
A sausage patty was served with the meal along with optional cereal.
Today is sure to be a great day!

Today I'm thinking about **Ruby**:

As the learning continues on campus it would be a shame for it to stop here!
I an awesome test-driven-development resource for learning ruby.
Let's do the first few steps together.
Here is the website: [http://rubykoans.com/](http://rubykoans.com/)

Download the Koans and [install ruby on your computer](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

Open up the command line and navigate into the unzipped Ruby Koans directory.

Type and run: `ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb`

You should see some slightly esoteric colored output, let's see what it says:

```
qst0s-iMac:koans qst0$ ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb
AboutAsserts#test_assert_truth has damaged your karma.

The Master says:
  You have not yet reached enlightenment.

The answers you seek...
  Failed assertion.

Please meditate on the following code:
  /Users/qst0/Desktop/koans/about_asserts.rb:10:in `test_assert_truth'

mountains are merely mountains
your path thus far [X_________________________________________________] 0/282
```

My output in the post isn't colorful, but we can solve our first puzzle.

Remember:

RED - Write a failing test and run it (Hey we just ran a failing test!)

Green - Make the test pass. (Okay so now let's do that.)

Open up the Koans directory in your favorite text editor:

I use vim: `vim .`

```

The command `vim .` works because our current directory can be referred to with `.`

select `about_asserts.rb` and let's read the code.

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# -*- ruby -*-

require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/neo')

class AboutAsserts < Neo::Koan

  # We shall contemplate truth by testing reality, via asserts.
  def test_assert_truth
    assert false                # This should be true
  end

  # Enlightenment may be more easily achieved with appropriate
  # messages.
  def test_assert_with_message
    assert false, "This should be true -- Please fix this"
  end

  # To understand reality, we must compare our expectations against
  # reality.
  def test_assert_equality
    expected_value = __
    actual_value = 1 + 1

    assert expected_value == actual_value
  end
```

We shall contemplate truth by testing reality, via asserts!

Change the `assert false    # This should be true` to true

Feel free to fix more of the broken code, but don't forget the third step:

Refactor: Look at the code and see what you can make better.

I might as well add a step 3.2:

Reflect: Think about what fixing this error is teaching you!

Return to the command line and run: `ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb` again.

__Mountains are merely mountains.__

The TODO list:
* Contract work (at least 2 hours)
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine / 42 Exam proctoring
* Buy winning team (K.I.F.T Contest) tasty treats.

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

I hope you join me again tomorrow for more breakfast and code!

What did you learn yesterday that you can learn again today?

Have a wonderful day,
