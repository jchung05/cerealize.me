It wasn't even a few days ago I wrote about my love for waffles.
This waffle, described in a moment of passion as dank luscious flavor pockets,
changed everything this morning. I was ready for the day. Now the day isn't ready for me.
So what am I so excited about? What am I thinking about...

Today I'm thinking about **C++**:

I've been talking about the C Piscine and 42 on and off as I repeatedly admit my love for breakfast.
One of the series of projects I have still not had the pleasure of partaking is the C++ Piscine.
Normally reserved for students that have returned from their first internship the C++ is a
journey into OPP, Object Oriented Programming. Why is that so interesting?
Why am I so excited to learn? Well beside excitement being my resting state and learning my passion:
Object Oriented Programming and the dauntingly feature rich world of C++ open doors.
Doors to a command over your computer that make the 1970's cry.
A foundational knowledge that reaches deep into the soul of progress.
A platform for building anything and a toolset like the library of babel.
Windows 95? C++ Enough said.

The TODO list:

* Email C++ Invite to all Cadets (Lv 7+)

The Ice Box:
* Contract work (call my manager)
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

What quests do you strive to continue?

What quest starts soon in your life?

When was the last time you had a waffle?

To the endless quest and questions of life,

As we find ourselves moving into the answers,
