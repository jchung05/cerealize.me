![Eggs, Toast, Potato & Onions](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-14.jpg)
A savory breakfast of fried eggs, onions and potatoes.
I had my eggs made over-easy so I could enjoy the yolk with toast.
The zing of the onions along with the salted potatoes mixed well with the yolk.
I washed it all down with a sweet glass of apple juice and started my day.

Today I'm thinking about OpenBSD:

Have you ever used `ssh`, `stat` or `vi`? How about `whois`, `env` or `cal`?
These essential programs and more are all open source!
They are part of the OpenBSD project and you can take a look at the code.
Learn more about C, learn more about a system of programs everyone uses.
OpenSSH, one of the many many programs in the project is something I use everyday. You can checkout the project here: [openbsd.org](https://www.openbsd.org/). I suggest reading the manual pages and source for one of your favorite programs in the project. If you don't have a favorite yet find one today!

The TODO list:
* Polish the J-Gravity website
* Teach scale creation to bocalian peers
* Start new contract work
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* Turn in a Hercules project
* ~~J-Gravity link with Dispatcher -HP ~~

Still many things to do. I need to polish the site with help from the team.
I should start my contract work and get back into the b_gfx projects.
This list lingers. Can I release myself of it's burden today?

Make your day awesome and share your joy with others,
