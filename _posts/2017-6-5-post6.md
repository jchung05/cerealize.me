I didn't post over the weekend, I was at a yo-yo contest then had a busy Sunday.
Today's breakfast was fantastic.
I took a small portion because I was still waking up,
but took a picture of my friend's who went for the bagel too.
The scramble was just what I needed, along with a glass of orange juice and water.
Great stuff.

Today I'm thinking about K.I.F.T.

I just wrote a new project the last week for the students at 42.
It's themed with the classic TV show Knight Rider.
The goal of the project is to recreate something to the effect of the TV show's K.I.T.T.
but really more along the lines of Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
This project was made to be very hard and has some serious limitations.
They must use the embedded C library PocketSphinx.
This is just one of the things that makes this project hard.
I can't wait to see what the teams get done on day one.
They have two whole weeks, but that might not even be enough time for some.
Good luck!

The TODO list:
* J Gravity website
* Meeting for contract work
* Program more!
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in hercules projects
* Revisit the taut.tech project
* ~~Figure it out (unit test libft_part1 timeout ???)~~

I didn't take much time to do what I said I would last post.
So I'll leave this one open so I don't feel bad about it.
I'm sure I'll be happy with my accomplishments today.
But moving toward a better blog should be a target always.
I did figure out the problem I was talking about on Friday. That felt great.
