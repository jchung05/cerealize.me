Two weeks ago there was a similar breakfast, but this time the egg patty was scrambled. It was buttery and flaky, as it should be, and the magic was not lost on me for this repeated venture in morning time goodness. The side of fruit was upgraded to include blackberries and strawberries alongside the wonderful assortment of melons I've become accustom to. I am spoiled by such a fantastic morning ritual of magnificent tastes. I washed it all down with a glass of fresh orange juice.

Today I'm thinking about The Internship Fair:

The first-ever, soon-to-be often celebrated internship fair has arrived at 42 Silicon Valley for its debut. I'm excited to see the companies that visit our massive and disruptive educational fortress. We have newly upgraded the art and furniture across the entire lab. I even spent an hour or so building a giant sticky-note Charmander (Yes, the super-cute fire type Pok√©mon) on the wall! Today I'll be helping move table to help set up booths for our visitors and setting up our own booth for J-Gravity. The whole evening will be followed by a BBQ outside the school. I'm excited for the day and the future!

The TODO list:
* Internship Fair

The DONE list:
* Finish the [J-Gravity website](https://jgravity.42.us.org)

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

I found out in a bit of re-read that none of my ~strike outs~ have been working on the TODO list. So now you have it: TODO, DONE, Ice Box.

I have only one thing to focus on today: The Internship Fair and how I can help my peers at 42 show the world who we are and that we are amazing!

Have a fantastic day,
