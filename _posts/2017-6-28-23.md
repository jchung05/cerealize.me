Another morning started with pancakes!
I love pancakes, especially with fruit toppings and granola.
I enjoyed a glass of apple juice and an apple proper to finish the apple trifecta.
I've been sleeping in pretty late these days and staying busy...

Today I'm thinking about **Pancakes**:

Super busy still!

Back 2016-6-29:</br>
Everything got so busy with all the new students this week that I even took a moment
to help out the Cantina with dishes! I have a few more things to finish myself too!
The breakfast dish for the last three days has been pancakes because it has been so busy,
and I have been so late to wake up, that the original meal materials run out!
The cinnamon and granola kept it interesting but I'm happy that today (yes I'm writing this from the future!)
was back to eggs and potatoes. So here is my bit on pancakes:

Have you ever noticed that Waffles are better than pancakes?

This is coming from someone that had the moniker "flyinpancake" for many years.
I am also bias, since waffle house is one of my favorite establishments.
It's not the price, or the quality, which could stand to be improved.
It's how true they are to each location being the same experience.
Even fast food franchises that are known around the states and the world
change the menu to fit the local. Waffle house, same menu. Maybe prices change.
But to bring a halt to my rambling: Waffle house doesn't serve pancakes.
The international house of pancakes on the other hand: serves waffles.
I know that doesn't sound like it means much. But it definitively proves
the value of waffles in my world.

More history on my "flyinpancake" moniker:

I was playing the game Ragnarok online and I needed a name.
I was on my older brothers account and it just so happened that a user named:
flying_muffin went by. I recalled from earlier that week or month (it's all blurred now)
that I had played a scrolling shooter and the bomber plane you could play as was called
"The Flying Pancake". I tried the name flyingpancake, to little surprise it was taken.
I dropped the 'g' and the rest is history. I said goodby to my m450ny0ung login.
That leaves me in a twirl of nostalgia... another day.

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine
* Finish this week of posts!

The Ice Box:
* Contract work (at least 2 hours)
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

I'll come back and finish these!

But I have to make sure I have all my work done for the Bocal first!

Did you have a good day today?
I know it's not the day this was first written, so take a trip back to when it was.

Do you find it easier to remember the good or the bad?

To the good we can find in our past and future,
