![Pancakes and Sausage](http://cerealize.me/images/2017-6-23.jpg)
Amazing homemade apricot jam with three buttermilk pancakes.
I happened to eat with a veracious vegetarian this morning
so I got to enjoy two sausage patties. The spectacular was served
alongside a bowl of melon and strawberries.
As I enjoy the rest of these bites I'm thinking about...

Today I'm thinking about the **Machine Learning**:

It's all the buzz around campus along with block-chain!

Machine learning and AI will be making big changes to our world in no time.
But how do you go about understanding the topic and using it yourself?
I'm learning just that the next month, along with more OOP
(Object Oriented Programming). In 2007, 10 years ago from writing this,
the world's best driverless car could only go about 7 miles.
Now you can make your own, and [online courses want to help you](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/).
What else can you do with machine learning? We have solved games,
we are listening to sounds and identifying pictures.
This might not sound spectacular at first, but here is the point:
The computers are getting better than humans.
Take something [like knowing the breed of a dog](https://www.what-dog.net/).
You can take a picture of any marvelous mutt and
have deep learning take a guess. That guess is very accurate.
Much more accurate than a human trying to do the same.
Even a highly trained professional cannot make the same number of
comparisons that machine vision can. We live in a world where
very soon we should be able to photograph what we don't understand and
get an analysis from finely tuned (by humans) learning and AI.
We can get recommendations for communities and music we might love.
We have so much more to learn!

The TODO list:
* J-Gravity Dispatcher link (finish serializing)
* J-Gravity Admin Actions / Dispatcher feedback.
* Contract work (5.5+ hours behind)

The Ice Box:
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

What heuristics do you use everyday that could be used to train AI?

What do you expect from the future of Machine Learning?

Let's ask ourselves today:

What is truly human?

What can computers do that humans can't?

Never stop learning,
