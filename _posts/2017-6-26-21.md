Juicy water and musk melon with a bomb-diggity chorizo burrito.
I enjoyed both immensely alongside a glass of orange juice.
What am I thinking about today? Well that's easy...

Today I'm thinking about **The Piscine**:

"The Piscine", piscine meaning swimming pool in French, is a month long trial.
Do you want to come study at 42 Silicon Valley? Want to have a month like no other?
The Piscine is for someone who is ready to code for 10+ hours a day for 28 days.
Even if you don't think you are ready for that, the piscine is the place to learn.
It's a teacher-less peer-controlled and corrected guided learning system.
You see how your code runs agains a ruthless robotic (and heartless) unit-test.
You see how quickly you can learn. How helpful you can be to a community.
You learn what 42 is all about! I'll say no more about the content.
But I'll be getting everyone started at 8:42 this morning!

The TODO list:
* Finish this post!
* Contract work (at least 2 hours)
* Mentoring @ Ruby Piscine

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

I'll come back and finish this!

Back 2016-6-29:

Starting the piscine was non-stop for the last few days.
I still have lots to do and fix. But it was awesome.
I have to catch up for the next few posts it was so busy!

Are you staying busy too?

It's not a bad idea to relax when you can either!

To the best of both worlds,
