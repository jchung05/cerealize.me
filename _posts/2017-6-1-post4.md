Two Eggs, Served to Order, with Tater-tots and Toast.

This morning I went into the lab to work while only a few people were awake.
After that I returned to the 42 Cantina to have breakfast.
I chose to have my eggs over easy so I could have the yolk with my tots.
It was great. A classic breakfast and well enjoyed with a glass of apple juice.

Today I'm thinking about 42. I still have more contract work but I am coming to a point with the work.
I still need to visit the bank, it wasn't an issue yet, but the month is now June.
Last night there was a great party for some of the french exchange students from 42 Paris.
I am excited to visit in August. I should start planning more of the details.
Although I like to just go with the flow, some planning helps.

The TODO list didn't work well yesterday, but here it is again:
* More contract work 
* Accounting
* Yoga
* Programming
* Turn in projects
* Wolf3d with SNES controller
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game

Again, I need to find some time to make this blogging process better.
My own tools, and creating them, would help me further myself and the blog.
Heck, even using someone elses tools, as long as I understand them well.
I need to set of buttons that goes to the next and last post.
Since you can only read the current post on it's static page.
Also, gotta go get the pictures of these tasty breakfasts off my phone!
~~For now, enjoy a photo of eggs in a basket.~~
Okay I fixed that and learned a bit about `sips` for image resizing.
