Swedish meatballs with bearnaise sauce. Eller på svenska:
Köttbullar med bearnaise sås.
One of my favorite meals even at home in the USA.
Jet lag lunch for breakfast, but I'd have meatballs
any time of the day! The bearnaise sauce is amazing.
It's not swedish but it certainly is tasty!
A little bit of foreshadowing on adventure to come...
