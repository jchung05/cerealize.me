Chocolate Chip Pancakes and Sausage, what a sweet treat!
The sausage helped round the flavor back to a balanced breakfast.
Along with a glass of orange juice I'm ready to get back to the action.
So what is it I'm thinking about...

Today I'm thinking about **More C++**:

Today is the fifth day of the C++ Piscine, I'll have more to write later.
I'm busy this morning with the lab NFS outage,
corrections and catching up on these posts!

I'll have more content for you later awesome readers!

The TODO list:
* Help run C Piscine and C++ Piscine
* Machine learning project
* Contract work! (Or be hungry on vacation!)

The Ice Box:
* Loop event motion in Wolf3d memory game
* Turn in a Hercules project
* Revisit the taut.tech project

until later, when I finish this post!
