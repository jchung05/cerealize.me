Hello, I'm qst0--

I'm working on my project hub page using github pages.

This was based off a repo that I don't fully understand. I would rather blow this all up and start from a place where I can feel out all the details then this far down the line in the dark.

Thinking of a solution now...

I still don't have a solution to this. But I need to focus on it and not just comment on it and leave it alone again.
